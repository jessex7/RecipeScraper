In a 3-quart or larger pot, heat the oil over medium. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, chili powder, and oregano and cook, stirring often until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and the stock, raise the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes. While the soup is simmering, brush each tortilla with the oil, then stack on a cutting board. Cut the tortilla stack in half, then into 1/2-inch wide strips.  Arrange the strips on a sheet pan in a single layer (you may need to use more than one pan, or bake in rounds.) Season the strips with a few pinches of salt and bake until golden and crispy, about 10 minutes. Add the chicken or turkey meat to the soup pot and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for another 5 minutes to heat the turkey meat. To serve, top the soup with a handful of tortilla strips and cilantro, plus optional avocado, sour cream and cheese.", "name": "Tortilla Soup", "author": "SkinnyTaste"}
