Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl with water. Dip the beef in the egg, then into the breadcrumbs, patting it with the back of a fork so it sticks. Transfer to the air fryer basket in batches as needed. Spray the top of the beef with oil then air fry 400F in a single layer 5 minutes on each side, spraying the other side when you flip. Serve with rice and lime wedges, if desired."}
