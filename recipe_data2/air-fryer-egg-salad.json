Cook for 15 to 16 minutes, depending on your air fryer until the eggs are hard-boiled (time may vary depending on the make\u00a0and model of your air\u00a0fryer), play around with 1 egg to see how your air fryer cooks before making a whole batch. Once the eggs are cooked, remove them from the air fryer and run under cold water. Peel the eggs and chop them into small pieces. In a separate bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, salt, and pepper. Add the chopped eggs, chives to the bowl with the mayonnaise mixture. Stir until everything is well combined. Top with paprika and chives, for garnish. Serve the egg salad on top of your favorite bread, crackers, or lettuce leaves, or use it to make a sandwich. Enjoy!"}
