In a second shallow bowl combine the panko with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Dip the fish into the egg whites, then the panko. Set aside. Spray the basket with oil. Lay the fish on the basket in a single layer, in batches as needed. Spray the tops of the fish with oil and air fry 400F 8 minutes, turning half way, until golden and crisp. Serve fish on buns with lettuce and divide the sauce."}
