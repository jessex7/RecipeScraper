Mix to combine then cover and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender. Remove the lid, increase the heat to medium and cook an additional 2-3 minutes or until the sauce thickens slightly and coats the apples and excess liquid evaporates. Remove from the heat and set aside while you make the oats. In a small bowl, add the milk, chia seeds, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and maple syrup. Add the oats and mix to combine. Add 1/4 of the oat mixture to 2 mason jars (8oz) or airtight containers (with lids). Layer each evenly with \u00bc of the apples then top each with an equal amount of the remaining oats and 1 tablespoon walnuts. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Oats may be eaten cold, at room temperature or warm."}
