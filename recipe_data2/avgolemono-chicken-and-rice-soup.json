In a pot, combine the stems, chicken thighs and rice with the chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low and stir. Cover and cook the chicken until tender, 25 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken and stems from the broth. Discard the stems and transfer the chicken to a plate then shred with 2 forks. Meanwhile, increase the heat to medium-high and bring the stock up to an active simmer. In a large heatproof bowl, vigorously whisk the eggs until frothy. Add \u00bc cup lemon juice and mix to incorporate. While you whisk the eggs, gradually drizzle in 1 ladleful (about 1 cup) of the broth (it\u2019s OK if some grains of rice tag along) and mix until fully combined. Pour the lemon-egg mixture into the pot with the broth, immediately remove from the heat, and stir in the shredded chicken. Taste and add more lemon juice to taste. Garnish with a generous amount of fresh dill, black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil."}
