Carefully add the egg and boil for 7 minutes. Remove egg with a slotted spoon or small ladle and place immediately in a bowl of ice water and set aside. Meanwhile, put bread in the toaster and toast to desired doneness. Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Spray lightly with olive oil then lay the sliced halloumi in the pan. Cook for 45 seconds then, using a spatula, carefully flip and cook an additional 30 seconds, or until each side is nicely browned. Peel the cooked egg and slice in half. Place halloumi on the toasted bread then layer with the red pepper slices and avocado. Top with halved egg, microgreens, sunflower seeds, salt and pepper to taste."}
