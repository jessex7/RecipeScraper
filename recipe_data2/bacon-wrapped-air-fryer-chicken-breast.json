Transfer the chicken to the air fryer and air fry 380F about 6 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature of the chicken has reached 160F then increase to 400F for 1 minute to brown the bacon. Remove from the air fryer and transfer to a cutting board, let rest covered with foil for 5 minutes before slicing."}
