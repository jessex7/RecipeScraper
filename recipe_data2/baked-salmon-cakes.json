Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; when hot lightly spray with oil and add the salmon. Cook the salmon until browned on one side, about 4 to 5 minutes then turn and cook an additional 4 to 5 minutes or until salmon easily flakes. Set aside on a dish to cool, then flake the salmon into a large bowl. Add the olive oil to the pan, then add the the onion, celery, red and yellow bell peppers, parsley, capers, hot sauce, Old Bay seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large saute pan over medium-low heat and cook until the vegetables are soft, approximately 18 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool to room temperature. To the large bowl with the salmon add the breadcrumbs, mayonnaise, yogurt, mustard, cooled vegetable mixture, and eggs. Mix well. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, or freeze 10 minutes. This will make them easier to shape and become less sticky. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Spray a non-stick baking sheet with cooking spray. Shape the salmon into 15 (scant 1/4 cup each) cakes and place on prepared baking sheet. Bake the salmon cakes for 20 minutes, or until they are golden and cooked through."}
