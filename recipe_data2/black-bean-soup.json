Soak beans overnight.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil, then remove from heat and let the beans sit, covered for 1 hour. Drain and discard the water, then add 9 cups of fresh cold water. Add 1 bell pepper, 2 cloves garlic, the small onion and bay leaves to the beans. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the beans are tender, stirring occasionally. (Add water if necessary) Discard the veggies. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat oil on medium-low. Add chopped vegetables (onion, parsley, carrots, pepper, garlic) season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper, to taste and saut\u00e9 for about 5 to 6 minutes, or until soft. Add the vegetables to the soup after it has simmered an hour, then add wine, vinegar, cumin, oregano, bouillon, and adjust water if needed. Cover and simmer on low about 30 minutes, stirring. Remove bay leaves, then using an immersion blender, partially blend the soup for about 10 seconds to thicken. If you don't have an immersion blender, put about 3 cups of the soup in a blender, then add it back to the pot. Adjust 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper and cumin to taste and ladle about 1 1/4 cups into each bowl. Top with sour cream if desired, chopped onions, scallions, chives or/or cilantro and enjoy!"}
