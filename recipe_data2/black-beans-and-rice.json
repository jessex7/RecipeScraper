Add the sofrito and cook until it melts and becomes fragrant, stirring 3 to 4 minutes. Add the rinsed beans and rice and mix well. Add the water, sazon, bouillon and salt, stir and let it cook, boiling over medium heat until the liquid is almost all absorbed and just skims the top of the rice. Quickly cover the lid and cook low heat 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let it sit 5 to 8 minutes more, without lifting the lid so the steam finishes the rice. Fluff with a fork and enjoy."}
