Spritz the shrimp with oil on both sides and rub all over. Coat the shrimp with the spice mix. In a medium size pot, bring 2 cups of chicken broth, milk, water and salt to a boil, careful it doesn't boil over. Slowly stir in the grits and stir continuously until the grits are well mixed. Bring the pot to a boil, reduce heat to the lowest setting, cover with a fitted lid and simmer for approximately 28 to 30 minutes, stirring after the first 5 minutes then again occasionally to prevent the grits from sticking on the bottom; adding more water if necessary. The grits should have a smooth consistency similar to cream of wheat. Stir in the butter and 1 ounce of the cheddar and the Parmesan cheese, remove the grits from the heat and keep warm. Just before the grits are done, heat a large cast-iron skillet with the olive oil over medium-high. Add the shrimp, and cook until the spices are darkened and aromatic, and the shrimp is opaque, about 2 minutes per side. Divide the grits among 4 plates and top with remaining cheddar cheese, then nestle the shrimp on top. Add the remaining 1/2 cup broth to the skillet to deglaze the pan and cook about 1 minute over medium heat until it reduces by half, drizzle over each plate. Garnish the whole dish with the scallions. Serve immediately with lime wedges for serving."}
