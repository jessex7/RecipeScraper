Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon reserving the fat. To the same pot, add the onion and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Saute, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 6 minutes, until browned and fragrant. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for just 20 to 30 seconds, before the garlic scorches. Add the chicken broth to deglaze the pan, and stir in the kale. Add a splash of red wine vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cover and simmer on medium-low stirring occasionally until the kale becomes tender, but not mushy, about 18 to 20 minutes. If the broth evaporates, add a little more water to make sure it doesn\u2019t burn on the bottom. Serve topped with pancetta."}
