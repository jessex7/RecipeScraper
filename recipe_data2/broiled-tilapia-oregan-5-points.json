Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Adjust the top rack 6 to 8 inches from the heating element. Rinse tilapia and pat dry with paper towels. Season the fish with salt, black pepper and oregano. Transfer to the prepared pan arranged in a single layer. Top with crushed garlic, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle breadcrumbs. Set broiler to low and place fish on the rack. Cook until the breadcrumbs are golden brown and the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, about 6 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness (be careful not to burn). No need to turn the fish.  Serve with lemon and your favorite vegetables."}
