Add onions and cook until they have caramelized slightly, about 5 minutes. Add black beans, paprika, cumin and salt; stir to combine and heat through, 3 to 4 minutes. While that cooks, heat a large skillet over high heat, when hot spray with oil and add the chicken. Cook until browned and cooked through in the center, about 5 minutes, flipping so it cooks on each side. Set aside in a medium bowl and toss with the hot sauce. Pour 3/4 cup rice in each bowl, top each with 1/4 cup beans and cheese, divide the chicken over the bowls. If eating right away, I like to melt the cheese by putting it in the microwave 30 seconds. Top with scallions. Refrigerate up to 4 days. To reheat, microwave about 3 minutes or until heated through."}
