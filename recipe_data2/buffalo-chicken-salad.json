Use a rotisserie chicken breast or even canned chicken works here. In a mini chopper, chop all the veggies, then add the chicken and pulse a few times. Transfer to a bowl and mix with the mayo and hot sauce, adding more to taste. To serve, spoon into lettuce wraps and garnish with red onion, celery leaves and more hot sauce."}
