In a medium skillet, heat oil on medium heat. Add the chopped onions, garlic, cilantro or parslet and red pepper, saute until soft, about a minute. Add the chicken and season with cumin and adobo. Add beans and 1 to 1-1/2 cups of water and simmer for about 5-10 minutes, until it thickens and the liquid reduces. Cut the peppers in half removing seeds and stem. Place peppers in an oven-proof dish. Fill each pepper with 1/3 cup of chicken and bean mixture. Pour about 1/3 cup water or chicken broth in the bottom of the baking dish. (This helps them steam and soften.) Cover tight with foil. Bake 30 minutes, until the peppers are soft. Remove foil, top with cheese and bake uncovered another 5 minutes, until the cheese melts."}
