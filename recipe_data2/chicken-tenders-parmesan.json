Line a sheet pan with foil and spray. Season chicken with salt. Place egg in a shallow bowl. In a second shallow bowl, add the breadcrumbs. Dip chicken in the egg, then into the breadcrumb mixture and shake off excess and place on a sheet pan. Spray both sides of the chicken generously with oil. Bake the chicken 18 minutes flipping halfway until cooked through. It\u2019s ok if it\u2019s not crispy, it\u2019s going to get covered in marinara anyway. Transfer to a 9\u00d713-inch baking pan, arrange the chicken strips. Spread the marinara sauce over the chicken and top with the mozzarella and Parmesan. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, until marinara is hot and the cheese is melted. Top with basil."}
