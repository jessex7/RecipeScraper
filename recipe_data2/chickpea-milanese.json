Mix well with a spatula, it should hold together well to form a ball and be only slightly sticky. If too sticky, add a little more flour. Flour your hands and roll it into a ball.\u00a0Divide the mixture in 4 portions and form 4 balls. Put breadcrumbs into a large shallow bowl, place a ball on top and press with your fingers adding some crumbs on top so your fingers don\u2019t stick to form a thin cutlet about 1/4 inch thin. Flip to cover both sides with breadcrumbs. Repeat with the remaining balls. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the cutlets on both sides for about 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden. Divide 1 1/2 cups arugula on each plate with 1/4 cup each of tomatoes and chickpeas seasoned with salt and pepper and serve over the cutlets, with plenty of lemon for squeezing."}
