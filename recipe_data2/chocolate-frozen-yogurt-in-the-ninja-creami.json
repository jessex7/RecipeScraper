Whisk in the milk to combine. Pour into an empty Creami pint. Place storage lid on pint and freeze flat (make sure it\u2019s not on an angle) for 24 hours. Remove pint from freezer and remove the lid. Assemble bowl into machine as referred to in the manual and select ICE CREAM. When processing is complete, open and if it looks crumbly, add it back to the machine and press the re-spin button and process a little more. Remove ice cream from pint and serve right away. Top with your favorite ice cream toppings! I love it drizzled with a little chocolate syrup, whipped cream and sprinkles."}
