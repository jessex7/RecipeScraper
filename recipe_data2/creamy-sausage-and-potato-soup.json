Add the sausage links, crumble, and cook until browned, about 7 minutes,\u00a0 stirring often. Using a slotted spoon, remove the sausage and set aside in a bowl. Immediately add 1 teaspoon oil, and then the onion and garlic. Cook until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add the Italian seasoning and stir well to coat the vegetables. Add the beans and broth to the pot and stir. Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until creamy. If you don\u2019t have an immersion blender, transfer the soup mixture to a high-speed blender and blend until creamy. Return to the pot. Add the cooked sausage, potatoes, and salt and pepper, and bring the soup to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and let the soup simmer for about 30 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Once the potatoes are tender, add the spinach to the pot. Simmer for 1 minute and then serve."}
