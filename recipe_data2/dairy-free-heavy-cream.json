Cover and let soak at room temperature for 4 hours. Drain the nuts, rinse well, and drain again. Transfer them to a high-speed blender, add the water, lemon juice, salt, and vinegar, and blend on high speed for about 1 minute, until very smooth and creamy. There should be no visible bits of cashew. If needed, scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and blend again for 30 seconds. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 5 days."}
