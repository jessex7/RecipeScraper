Meanwhile, in a large bowl combine the egg whites, cottage cheese, garlic powder and seasoning salt. Add the veggies and mix. Using 12 cup muffin tin, line each cup with a half slice turkey bacon around the edges and pour in the egg mixture, about 1/3 cup each. Top with the shredded cheese and bake in the center of the oven about 25 minutes, until set."}
