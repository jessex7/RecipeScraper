Line a baking sheet with a silicon baking mat or\u00a0parchment paper. If using parchment paper, spray with oil to avoid sticking. In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder and salt and whisk well. Add the yogurt and mix with a fork or spatula until well combined, it will look like small crumbles. Lightly dust flour on a work surface and remove dough from the bowl, knead the dough a few times until dough is smooth and tacky, but not sticky, about 15 turns (it should not leave dough on your hand when you pull away). Divide dough into 16 equal balls. Dust your work surface and a rolling pin with more flour. Press a ball flat then roll into a\u00a0 4 \u00bd-inch oval. Wrap the dough around a hot dog half and place on the prepared baking sheet.\u00a0Repeat with remaining hot dogs and dough. Brush each with the egg wash and sprinkle with Everything Bagel seasoning. Bake in oven for 25 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes and serve."}
