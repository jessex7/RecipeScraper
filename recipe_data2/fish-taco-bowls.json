Season all over with seasoning. Cut 1 lime into wedges and halve the other. Combine mayo and sriracha or chipotle and squeeze 1/4 of the lime. Add a little water until it\u2019s easy to drizzle later. Air fry the fish 6 minutes 400F shaking the basket half way. Meanwhile, combine slaw with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, remaining half lime and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Divide on 4 plates, add fish on the side and drizzle the spicy mayo over the fish. Serve with lime wedges and garnish with cilantro. No air fryer, no problem! Heat a skillet on high heat, spray with oil and cook 5 to 6 minutes."}
