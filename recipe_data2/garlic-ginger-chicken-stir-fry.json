Stir to combine. Remove \u2153 cup of the marinade and set aside. Add the chicken to the remaining marinade and let sit for at least 15 minutes up to 4 hours. Heat a large, heavy cast-iron or stainless steel skillet with a lid over high heat. Pour 1 teaspoon of the vegetable oil into the pan and swirl to coat. Use a slotted spoon to add half the chicken to the skillet, and stir and scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon. Cook chicken for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. (Cover briefly, as needed, to prevent splatters.) Transfer to a plate and set aside.  If your skillet has caked-on starch or burned garlic, return it to the heat and add a cupful of water to help scrape it off. Discard into the sink and wipe the skillet dry with paper towels. Heat another 1 teaspoon of oil. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Clean the skillet once more and pour in the remaining teaspoon of oil. Once hot, stir in the onions and saut\u00e9 them until they are lightly charred but still retain some crunch, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken back in. Pour in the remaining marinade and add 1/2 cup water. Cook for another minute, then stir in the bok choy until wilted. Transfer to a platter and top with the crushed peanuts and basil. Serve over rice, or cauliflower rice, if desired. Makes 8 cups."}
