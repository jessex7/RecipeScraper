Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Spray with oil and add the zucchini, grill on each side about 2 minutes each, until grill marks form. Set aside. Spray one side of each slice of bread. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Place 2 slices of bread oiled side down on the skillet. Top each piece of bread with 1 ounce of cheese, divide the zucchini on top, grilled chicken, tomato slices and basil and the remaining cheese. Top with the remaining bread oil side up. Use a heavy pot or skillet to press it down and cook until the bottom piece of bread is golden, about 4 to 5 minutes. Use a spatula to carefully flip the sandwich over. Cook until the other slice of bread is golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Cut in half diagonally and serve with your favorite soup."}
