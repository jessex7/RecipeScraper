Combine mustard and honey and marinate the pork chops at least 4 hours or overnight for best results. Place panko in a large shallow bowl. Leaving whatever mustard that clings to the pork, press into the panko crumbs. Discard the rest of the marinade (about 2 tbsp tossed). Lightly spray the basket with oil and transfer the chops, in batches as needed. Spritz the top with oil and air fry 400F 10 to 12 minutes turning half way, spritzing both sides with oil. Although they come out much crisper in the air fryer, if you don\u2019t have one you can bake them 425F 20 to 25 minutes."}
