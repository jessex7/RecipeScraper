Place the chicken in the egg whites, then in cornstarch and season with 3/4 teaspoon salt. Spray a large nonstick sheet pan generously with olive oil spray (so the chicken doesn\u2019t stick) then add the chicken pieces, leaving room for the broccoli on one end. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove chicken from oven and flip, then add broccoli on the other half of the pan and drizzle with 2 teaspoons sesame oil, season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper, to taste. Place back in the oven and cook until the chicken is cooked through and the broccoli is tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl whisk honey, sriracha sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil together until smooth. Add the chicken and toss in sauce to coat. Divide all the ingredients to 4 meal prep bowls, top with scallions and sesame seeds."}
