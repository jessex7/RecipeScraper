Oil a 6 1/2- to 7-inch round metal, glass, ceramic, or stoneware baking pan. (I used the one I bought for my air fryer) In a large bowl, mash the banana very well until there are no lumps. Add the milk and maple syrup and mix until well combined. In a separate bowl, mix together the oats, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the pecans, the coconut, dates or raisins, if using, and chia seeds. Add to the mashed banana and mix to combine. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and even it out with a spatula. Sprinkle with cinnamon and place the pan on a trivet or rack. Cover with foil and then lower the trivet into the Instant Pot. Lock the lid into place, set the Pressure Release Knob to Sealing, cook at high pressure 35 minutes. Once the cooking cycle is done, let the pressure release naturally. Using silicone mini mitts, carefully remove the trivet with the pan and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Use a knife to loosen the sides and slice into 4 pieces. Top with the remaining chopped pecans and cinnamon, and serve. The bars can be stored, refrigerated in a closed container, for up to 5 days."}
