Reduce heat to maintain temperature without allowing broth to come to a boil. Set Instant Pot or similar multi cooker to saut\u00e9 function at high. Lay prosciutto in to bottom of the pan and cook until brown and crispy, 2 minutes on each side.\u00a0 Remove to a plate and set aside. Reduce the heat setting to medium, add the olive oil, shallot and garlic and cook, stirring until softened, about 2 minutes. Add rosemary, salt, and pepper, stirring for 30 seconds. Stir in rice, allowing the grain to become coated with the fat, and cook 1 more minute. Add the wine and stir to insure any browned bits are lifted from the bottom of the pan. Add the hot broth and cover the Instant Pot with the lid and close the vent closed (sealing position). Set to pressure cook function at high for 6 minutes. Quick release the pressure (venting), open the lid. Set Instant Pot function to saut\u00e9 at medium. Add the peas and continually stir for 2 minutes until the remaining liquid is absorbed, the peas are heated through and the rice is creamy. Turn off heat and stir in the cheese. Serve rice with pieces of the crispy prosciutto."}
