Set aside 2 tablespoons then place salmon in a shallow bowl or Tupperware container and add the rest of the marinade. Refrigerate and allow to marinate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. (If you don't have time, you can let it marinade 20 minutes) In a medium bowl, add the mayonnaise, gochujang and 1 tablespoon water. Whisk to combine.\u00a0 Add the coleslaw and scallions and toss to combine. Heat a clean outdoor grill (make sure the grates are clean and lightly oiled) or if cooking indoors an oiled grill pan over medium-high heat. Place salmon pieces, flesh side down, on the grill and cook 3-5 minutes (thinner fillets will cook quicker than a thicker piece), or until salmon easily releases from the grill and is nicely charred. Carefully flip with a spatula, top each piece with a tablespoon of reserved marinade and cook an additional 2-4 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Set aside on a clean cutting board or plate. Meanwhile, heat the tortillas over an open flame, on the grill or microwave. Place 2 tortillas each on 4 plates. Using a spatula, break up the fish into pieces, sliding the spatula between the flesh and skin to remove the skin. Place a piece or 2 of salmon on each tortilla then top each with 1/3 cup slaw.\u00a0 Repeat with remaining fish and slaw.\u00a0 Serve immediately."}
