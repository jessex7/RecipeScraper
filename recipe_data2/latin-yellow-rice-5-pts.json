Add rice and saute 2 minutes longer, stirring frequently. Add water, bouillon cube, saz\u00f3n plus 1 teaspoon salt. Taste 4 cups water and taste for salt, it should be flavorful and salty enough, adjust as needed. Let the water boil on a high heat stirring once at this point. As the water boils down and just barely skims the top of the rice, reduce heat to very low and cover 15 minutes. The steam will cook the rice so do not open the lid. After 15 minutes, shut the flame off and let it sit at least 5 more minutes without touching the lid. The steam will finish cooking the rice without burning the bottom. Then fluff with a fork and enjoy."}
