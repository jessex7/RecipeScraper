Cook high 4 hours. Remove and shred with two forks, discard the liquid. Meanwhile, combine the cream cheese, sour cream, vinegar and hot sauce together until smooth. Add half of the blue cheese. Transfer to the slow cooker with the chicken, mixing well and return to the slow cooker, cook low 2 to 3 hours. Transfer to a serving dish and top with the remaining blue cheese, garnish with scallions. Serve hot. Buy a rotisserie chicken and remove the breast meat from the bones, removing the skin and shred. Save the rest of the chicken for another recipe. Preheat the oven to 350F. Place chicken in a large bowl, then mix the cream cheese, sour cream, vinegar and hot sauce together until smooth. Add half of the blue cheese and place them in a baking dish. Bake 350F until hot, about 20 to 25 minutes."}
