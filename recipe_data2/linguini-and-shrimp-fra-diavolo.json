While the water is heating up, heat 2 teaspoons of the olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and cook until golden, about one minute. Add the shrimp and cook 2-3 minutes to brown but not cook through; sprinkle with salt to taste. Transfer the shrimp to a plate, leaving garlic in the pan. Pour the remaining teaspoon of olive oil and add the celery and onions; cook 2 minutes then add the crushed tomatoes, season with salt and crushed red pepper and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat and let it simmer about 8-10 minutes. Meanwhile, add pasta to water and cook according to package directions for al dente. Once the sauce is ready, add the shrimp and cook another minute or two; remove from heat and add the capers. Serve in a large bowl over pasta topped with fresh basil and fresh black pepper. Optional, Parmesan cheese on the side."}
