Spray lightly with oil and add the butter. Once the butter has melted and starts to foam, add the onions and \u00bc teaspoon salt. Cook the onions for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges have browned, stirring often. Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a small bowl with 1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper, to taste. When the onions have browned, add the eggs and scramble until almost cooked through. Just before eggs are set, turn off the heat and add the salmon. Gently fold in the salmon until heated through and evenly combined, about 30 seconds. Top with chives or scallions and serve."}
