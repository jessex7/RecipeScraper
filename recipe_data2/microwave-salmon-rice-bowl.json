Meanwhile, In a small bowl combine red chili sauce sauce, sriracha and ginger. Remove from microwave and stir, place the halved baby bok choy on the edges of the bowl. Place the salmon filet skin side down in the center. Top everything with a pinch of salt. Drizzle the sesame oil over the bok choy. Brush the sauce over the salmon and cover, vented. Microwave 3 to 4 minutes, until the salmon is cooked through. I usually do 3 minutes for one piece."}
