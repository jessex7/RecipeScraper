Cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Add the onion and corn (no need to thaw) and saut\u00e9 for 10 minutes. Add the orzo and chicken broth, stir to combine then bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer 10 minutes, stirring every few minutes and scraping the bottom of the pot to make sure the orzo doesn\u2019t stick. Remove from the heat, add the spinach, stir and cover for a couple minutes, until the spinach has wilted. Top with freshly grated parmesan and black pepper, to taste and serve."}
