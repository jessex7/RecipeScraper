Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil for easiest cleanup. Combine mayo, Parmesan, garlic and herbs in a small bowl. Place salmon, skin side down, onto lined baking sheet. Cover salmon with another piece of parchment or foil. Partially bake salmon for 8 minutes. Remove from oven and remove top piece of parchment paper. Spread the top with the Parmesan herb mixture. Return to oven uncovered and bake until the top has browned, and the salmon flakes easily with a fork. The salmon should register 135\u00ba F when checked with an internal thermometer probe, about 15 to 18 minutes if the fish is 1 1/2 inches thick, less or more depending on the thickness."}
