Spray the steak lightly all over with olive oil, then season both side generously with kosher salt and black pepper. When the oven is ready, heat the a heavy skillet or cast iron skillet over high heat until the pan is very hot. When hot, add the steaks and cook, without moving for 2 1/2 minutes. Turn over and cook an additional 2 to 2-1/2 minutes. Sear the sides of the steaks for about 1 minute so it's browned all over. Place the steaks in the oven for about 4 to 5 minutes, then check them with the meat thermometer inserted into the side of the steak. Remove when the steaks read 125\u00b0 F for Medium Rare, or 130\u00b0 F for medium. Let them rest 5 to 10 minutes before serving (meat temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees after it is removed from the oven)."}
