Pulse in the blender or food processor in about 4 to 5 batches until finely chopped and semi-smooth but still chunky, but don\u2019t over-blend it into a puree. You may have to stop and use a spoon to mix things around to get it to blend evenly. If you must, you can add a few teaspoons of water to each batch to help it blend. Transfer the sofrito into ice cube trays to freeze for later use. Can be frozen up to 6 months. Refrigerate up to 7 days."}
