If the sofrito is frozen, cover on low until it melts, then saute. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil, cover and simmer 15 minutes, until the flavors meld and thicken. Uncover and simmer 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring. If you want thicker beans, uncover and simmer longer. For soupier beans, add more water. Taste for salt before serving and adjust as needed. Serve over white rice, if desired."}
