Line a large baking sheet with a silicone liner or parchment paper. Place broth in a large pot and bring the broth to a gentle simmer, covered. Toss the onions and acorn squash with oil and salt and spread out on the prepared baking sheet. Roast for about 40 min, until the vegetables are cooked but not burnt. Meanwhile, place the cashews in a small bowl and top with 3/4 of the hot broth. Allow the mixture to stand 10 minutes to soften the nuts. When the vegetables are done, peel the squash and transfer the vegetables to the pot and add the ginger, turmeric, and cayenne. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then reduce the heat to medium and simmer, partially covered, for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse. Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the cashews. Pour the soup into your blender in batches and puree on high for 1 to 2 minutes, until smooth and creamy. (For conventional blenders, remove the small center lid cap and cover the opening with a kitchen towel so steam can escape while you blend.) Return the soup to the saucepan, season to taste, and eat warm. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls, top with cilantro and chopped cashews if using."}
