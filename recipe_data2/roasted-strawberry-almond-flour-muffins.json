Toss strawberries with 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Place on parchment paper-lined sheet pan in a single layer and roast 25 minutes, until the strawberries release their liquid and caramelize. Meanwhile, line a muffin tin with 12 muffin nonstick liners and spray with oil. Mix almond flour, oat flour, baking powder and baking soda with a whisk in a medium bowl. In a large bowl with a hand mixer, mix and cream the butter and sugar on medium setting for about 2 minutes. In a small bowl, beat the egg whites and vanilla with a whisk, add to bowl with butter/sugar mixture. Mix in the yogurt, then flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined, 1 minute. With a spatula, fold in the strawberries and spoon to lined muffin tins about 3/4 filled (I used an ice cream scoop). Bake at 375F or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool before eating."}
