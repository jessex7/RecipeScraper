In a medium bowl whisk together tomato paste, white wine and chicken broth. Press saute and add the oil in the instant pot, add the onions, bell peppers and garlic.\u00a0 Saute 3 to 4 minutes stirring, until softened then press cancel. Nestle the meat into the onions so that half are on the bottom and half are above the meat. Add the carrots, olives and bay leaves (and cilantro, if using). Pour the tomato sauce over the meat, cover and close the pressure cooker. Set to sealing and cook high pressure for 45 minutes. Then unplug the instant pot and do the natural release. Shred the beef in the pot and discard the bay leaves. Serve with rice, over bowls, tacos, etc. topped with more cilantro, if desired. Season the beef with salt, sazon, cumin, dried oregano, garlic powder and black pepper. In a medium bowl whisk together tomato paste, white wine and 3 cups of chicken broth (you\u2019ll need more on the stove with evaporation than the Instant Pot). Heat a large Dutch oven and add the oil, onions, bell peppers and garlic.\u00a0 Saute over medium-high heat 3 to 4 minutes stirring, until softened. Nestle the meat into the onions so that half are on the bottom and half are above the meat. Add the carrots, olives and bay leaves (and cilantro, if using). Pour the tomato sauce mixture over the meat, bring to a boil and cover. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the meat shreds easily with 2 forks, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, adding more water if it gets too dry. Shred the beef in the pot and discard the bay leaves. Serve with rice, over bowls, tacos, etc. topped with more cilantro, if desired."}
