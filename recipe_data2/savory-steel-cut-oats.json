You may need to adjust cook time and/or add extra water to reach your desired consistency. (I used about 2/3 cup water for creamy oats). Meanwhile, spray a medium skillet with oil. Remove the sausage from the casing, add to the skillet and cook over medium heat, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until just cooked through (don\u2019t overcook or it will become rubbery). Remove sausage from skillet and place in a serving bowl, cover and set aside while you cook the mushrooms. Add 1 teaspoon butter to the skillet. \u00a0When melted, add the mushrooms, a pinch of salt and pepper, to taste. Saut\u00e9 mushrooms for 4 minutes. Add the sausage back to the skillet, stir to combine and cook 30 seconds. Transfer cooked oats to a bowl, add remaining half teaspoon butter, a pinch of salt and 1 tablespoon Parmesan and stir. Top with mushroom and sausage mixture. Cook the egg runny, or to your likie and top the bowl.  Add the remaining tablespoon Parmesan cheese and chives, if using."}
