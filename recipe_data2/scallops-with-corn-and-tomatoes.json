Season with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and black pepper, to taste. Heat a large skillet on a high heat. When pan is hot, melt the butter and place the scallops in the pan.  Sear without touching them for a few minutes until the bottom forms a nice caramel colored crust. Turn over and cook about another minute or 2, until the center is slightly translucent (you can check this by viewing them from the side) and the bottom is seared. Be careful not to overcook. Remove from the pan and set aside on a warm plate.  Add 1 teaspoon oil and the corn, season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, until just about tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the Boursin cheese and 3 to 4 tablespoons water and cook, 1 to 2 minutes more, stirring.  Remove from heat, stir in the tomatoes and divide on 4 plates. Top with scallops and fresh chives, for garnish."}
