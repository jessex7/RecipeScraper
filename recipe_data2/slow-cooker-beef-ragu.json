Brown the meat, breaking it into smaller pieces with your spoon until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to the slow cooker. Add 2 teaspoons olive oil to the skillet. Add onions, celery and carrots and saut\u00e9 on medium-low for about 3 to 4 minutes, until soft. Transfer to the slow cooker, add the crushed tomatoes, bay leaves, and Parmesan rind if using, cover and cook low 4 to 6 hours. (Any longer, the sauce will burn.) When the meat sauce is ready, discard bay leaves and rind and serve."}
