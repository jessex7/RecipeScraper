Spray 2 sheet pans with oil and set aside. Gently remove the stems from the mushrooms and place stem-side down on the sheet pan. Spray with olive oil and sprinkle with 2 pinches of salt and pepper, to taste. Finely chop stems and place them in a large mixing bowl. To the large bowl, add the spinach, cream cheese, \u00bd cup parmesan cheese, mozzarella, scallions, garlic, sour cream, \u00bc teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Mix with a fork to thoroughly combine. Flip mushrooms stem-side up and stuff each mushroom with about 1 tablespoon filling, depending on the mushroom size, pressing mixture into the cavity of the mushroom and a small mound on top.  In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and remaining 2 tablespoons parmesan cheese. Top each stuffed mushroom with a sprinkle of breadcrumb mixture, gently spray tops with olive oil and bake for 25-30 minutes, rotating pans halfway through cooking to allow for even browning. Allow to cool slightly and with a spatula, transfer to serving platter to serve warm or at room temperature."}
