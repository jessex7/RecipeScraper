Transfer to cutting board, flip on its side and slice in half lengthwise. Flip it back over to lay flat on the cutting board and cut into 32 equal cubes. Place in a medium size shallow container so the cubes are in 1 even layer. In a small measuring cup or bowl, add the soy sauce and crushed garlic. Pour \u00bd the marinade (about 2 tablespoons) over the tofu, gently flipping to make sure all sides are covered. Marinate for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, peel and dice the cucumber and chop the scallions, separating whites from greens. Transfer the scallion whites and cucumbers to a small bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons of the remaining marinade. Set aside. Sprinkle marinated tofu with the cornstarch, tossing gently to coat. In a large skillet, heat the sesame oil over high heat.\u00a0 Add the tofu and cook for 2- 3 minutes, until the first side is browned. Flip cubes with a spatula, cooking each side for a couple minutes until evenly browned on all sides. Toss with remaining marinade. In 2 shallow bowls, layer each with 1 cup greens, \u00bd cup rice, half the edamame and cucumber/scallion mixture, 1 ounce avocado and \u00bd the cooked tofu. Garnish with scallion greens, sesame seeds and sriracha mayo, if using."}
