Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cover a large sheet pan with parchment paper and spray another small sheet pan with olive oil. Set aside. In a medium bowl, add the onions, garlic, olive oil, soy sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, smoked paprika and cumin. Whisk to combine then crumble the tofu with your hands into small pieces into the mixture. Toss gently to combine and evenly coat the tofu with the sauce. Spread tofu in an even layer on the parchment lined sheet pan. Place potatoes and jalape\u00f1os in an even layer on the small sheet pan. Toss with olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Transfer both sheet pans to the oven and cook for 35 minutes, tossing halfway through and rotating pans to allow for even browning. Meanwhile, warm the tortillas (over an open flame, in a pan or in the microwave).\u00a0 I prefer heating mine over an open flame, covering as them as I go to keep them warm. Place 2 tortillas each on 4 plates.\u00a0 Layer each tortilla with \u00bd an ounce avocado, then a layer of tofu then the potatoes and peppers. Top each taco with 1 tablespoon salsa and any additional (optional) toppings you desire and serve immediately."}
