Whisk until thoroughly combined, scraping sides of the jar with a spoon or spatula, if needed, to incorporate all the chia seeds. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. Meanwhile, in a small skillet over medium low heat, toast the coconut until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Let cool and store in a zip top bag or small Tupperware container until ready to use. When ready to eat, transfer pudding into 2 small serving bowls, about 1 cup each. Top each with kiwi, mango and shredded coconut, dividing the fruit evenly among the 2 bowls. Optional: Drizzle with a little extra syrup (or honey), if desired and serve."}
