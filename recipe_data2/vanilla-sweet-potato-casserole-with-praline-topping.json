Bake until tender, about 1 to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Set aside and let cool enough to handle. Meanwhile spray a 9 x 9 inch pan, 9 inch pie pan, or or 2 quart safe baking dish and set aside. Remove all the potatoes from the skin and mash with a fork or potato masher in a large mixing bowl. Add the milk, maple syrup, salt, spices and eggs to the bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until uniform in texture. Pour the mixture into the greased baking dish and smooth the top with a spatula. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the nuts, flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Stir in the butter or coconut oil and mix well. Sprinkle the mixture evenly across the top of the sweet potato mixture. Bake for 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before serving."}
