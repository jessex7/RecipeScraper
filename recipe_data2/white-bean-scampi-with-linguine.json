Cook the pasta about 1 minute less than the package instructions, reserve \u00bd cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta. In the same pot, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Cook the garlic, red pepper flakes, and black pepper until fragrant, 1 minute, Pour in the wine, add the salt and bring to a simmer. Let the liquid reduce thickened. Add the tomatoes and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, just enough time to warm them through without letting them soften. Add the spinach, a big handful at a time, and stir just until it wilts before adding more, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cooked pasta with the reserved pasta water. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid thickens and incorporates, about 1 to 2 minutes. Decrease the heat to medium. Add the beans and lemon juice and cook for another minute to warm through. Remove from the heat and finish with the butter, stirring until melted.  Serve right away, garnished with chopped parsley and grated Parmesan."}
