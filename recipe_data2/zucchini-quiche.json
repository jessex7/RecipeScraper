Remove the pie dough and allow to sit at room temperature while you prep your ingredients. Roll the dough out on a well-floured work surface until it\u2019s approximately 12- inches in diameter. Transfer it to a 9-inch deep pie dish. Using your fingers, press it firmly into the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Trim off any excess, leaving about 1/2-inch overhanging. Then fold/crimp the overhanging dough. Prick the bottom of the pie crust with the tines of a fork. Place crust on a small sheet pan (this makes is much easier to transfer to the oven once it\u2019s filled). Transfer the pie crust to your pre-heated oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until par-baked. Then remove. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 30 seconds.\u00a0 Add the zucchini, \u00bd teaspoon salt and pepper, to taste and toss to evenly combine. Cook for 7-8 minutes, stirring every couple minutes, until the zucchini has softened and flavors combined. With a slotted spoon, transfer three-quarters of the zucchini to par-baked crust. In a medium bowl, add the eggs, milk, ricotta, mozzarella, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, basil and \u00bd teaspoon salt and pepper, to taste. Using a fork, mix to combine until uniform. Pour egg mixture into the crust over the zucchini. Top with remaining zucchini and 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Cover the crust with aluminum foil so it doesn\u2019t burn and place in oven quiche in oven. Bake 350F 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until set and top is browned. Remove from oven and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Top with basil, slice into 6 pieces and serve."}
